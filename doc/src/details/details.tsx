                                            Since announcing its breach on Thursday, Equifax has taken a formidable beating in the media, and I suspect at virtually every office water cooler in the U.S. Waiting six weeks before telling consumers about the breach of their sensitive, personal information to first ‘get their story straight’ has many up in arms – and rightfully so. The company’s response has been no better, and likely made matters worse, with their questionable efforts to “protect” consumers in the future.

                                            News of yet another data breach, this time at credit bureau Equifax, was announced yesterday afternoon and sadly, it isn’t all that surprising.

From retail to healthcare, government agencies to financial services, no industry is immune. An estimated 143 million Americans and a smaller number of Canadians...

                                            Shortly after IoT became a mainstream topic, the idea of device access-control falling into the wrong hands also grabbed headlines. Was it possible? What would happen? These are particularly concerning questions for healthcare organizations who deal in life-saving devices. But the notion of hacked medical devices such as defibrillators, pacemakers and insulin machines seemed more science fiction than real risk – a few years...
